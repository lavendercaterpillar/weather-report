# Coworking Agreement
Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.


## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*
Scheduling based on Eastern Standard Time. Flexibility with scheduling and co-working session in the evening. Set times and days first, but adjust as necessary. Can send messages and updates at any time with the assumption that a response will come when available.


## Collaboration vs. individual work expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations- does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

Wave 1 : need to complete together
Wave 2-6 : divide and conquer tasks and we cannot move onto the next wave until we’ve completed the current wave. Switch driver and navigator while debugging and or completing tasks together. 


Collaboration tools: slack/github/vscode/google calendar
